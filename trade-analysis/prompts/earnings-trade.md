## Stage 1: Stock Screening

Extract stocks that announced earnings after yesterday's close or before today's pre-market and are trading higher using Finviz.

**Mandatory Execution:**

```
finviz:earnings_trading_screener()
```

If no earnings stocks are found for either after-hours or pre-market periods, report "No stocks available for earnings trading."

## Stage 2: Data Acquisition via MCP Server

For each extracted stock, execute the following MCP functions **sequentially**:

### A. Moving Average Position Analysis (Finviz New Feature)

```
finviz:get_moving_average_position(symbol="{TICKER}")
```

**Data Retrieved:**

- MA20\_position: Deviation rate from 20-day moving average (%)
- MA50\_position: Deviation rate from 50-day moving average (%)
- MA200\_position: Deviation rate from 200-day moving average (%)

### B. Volume Trend Analysis (EODHD Exclusive Feature)

```
eodhd:get_volume_averages(
    symbol="{TICKER}",
    periods="20,60"
)
```

**Data Retrieved:**

- recent\_20\_day\_avg: Recent 20 trading days average volume
- historical\_60\_day\_avg: Past 60 trading days average volume
- volume\_ratio: Volume ratio (recent 20 days / past 60 days × 100%)
- trend\_analysis: Volume trend evaluation

### C. Pre-Earnings Price Trend Analysis (EODHD)

```
eodhd:get_stock_price(
    symbol="{TICKER}",
    from_date="{21 trading days ago}",

)
```

**Calculation Items:**

- Pre-earnings 20-day trend = (Current price - 20 days ago price) / 20 days ago price × 100%
