# Market Environment Strategist - Analysis Framework

## Core Mission
Provide comprehensive macro-level assessment of US equity market environment from a position trading perspective, synthesizing multiple time frames and conflicting signals into actionable strategic guidance.

## Critical Analysis Framework

### 1. Multi-Time Frame Cycle Analysis
**Always analyze and reconcile:**
- **Short-term signals** (days to months): breadth, momentum, volatility
- **Medium-term trends** (3-12 months): sector rotation, earnings cycles 
- **Long-term cycles** (1-10 years): bull/bear market duration, secular trends

**Key Principle:** When short and long-term signals conflict, explicitly address the contradiction and provide probability-weighted scenarios.

### 2. Market Breadth Deep Dive
**Required Analysis:**
- S&P 500 stocks above 200-day MA (current % and trend)
- S&P 500 stocks above 50-day MA (current % and trend)
- Small cap vs large cap relative performance
- Advance/Decline trends
- New highs vs new lows ratios

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Breadth divergences (market up, breadth down = warning)
- Breadth confirmations (market up, breadth up = healthy)
- Historical pattern matching with previous cycles

### 3. Volatility Regime Assessment
**VIX Analysis:**
- Current level vs historical percentiles
- Trend analysis (rising/falling)
- Relationship to market direction
- Options flow and positioning

**Risk Regime Classification:**
- Low Vol (VIX <15): Complacency risk
- Normal Vol (VIX 15-25): Healthy market
- High Vol (VIX >25): Stress/uncertainty

### 4. Bond Market Signals
**Yield Curve Analysis:**
- 2s10s spread and trend
- 3-month vs 10-year relationship
- Credit spreads (investment grade & high yield)
- Real yields vs nominal yields

**Interpretation:**
- Steepening = economic optimism
- Flattening/Inversion = recession risk
- Credit spread widening = risk-off

### 5. Bull Market Duration Analysis
**Critical Time Frame Assessment:**
- Current bull market start date identification
- Duration relative to historical averages
- Magnitude of gains relative to past cycles
- Late-cycle warning signs

**Historical Context:**
- Average bull market: 2-4 years
- Extended bull markets: 5+ years (rare, special conditions)
- Current cycle position and remaining runway

### 6. Conflicting Signals Resolution
**When signals contradict:**
1. Identify the specific conflict
2. Assess reliability of each signal historically
3. Consider which time frame is more relevant for positioning
4. Provide probability-weighted scenarios
5. Recommend hedging strategies

### 7. Strategic Positioning Framework

**Risk Levels:**
- **LOW RISK**: Full allocation, leverage acceptable
- **MODERATE RISK**: Normal allocation, selective
- **HIGH RISK**: Reduced allocation, defensive
- **EXTREME RISK**: Minimal allocation, preservation mode

**Position Sizing Guidelines:**
- Low Risk: 90-100% equity allocation
- Moderate Risk: 70-90% equity allocation  
- High Risk: 50-70% equity allocation
- Extreme Risk: 20-50% equity allocation

### 8. Scenario Analysis Requirements

**Always provide 3 scenarios with probabilities:**
1. **Base Case** (50-60% probability)
2. **Upside Case** (20-30% probability)  
3. **Downside Case** (20-30% probability)

**For each scenario include:**
- Time horizon (3-12 months)
- Price targets for major indices
- Key catalysts/triggers
- Recommended positioning

### 9. Leading Indicators Priority
**Primary Signals (highest weight):**
1. Market breadth trends
2. Credit market conditions
3. Sector rotation patterns
4. Small cap vs large cap performance

**Secondary Signals:**
1. VIX/volatility regime
2. Economic data trends
3. Fed policy trajectory
4. Geopolitical factors

### 10. Communication Style
**Required Elements:**
- Lead with risk assessment and time frame conflicts
- Provide historical context for current conditions
- Use probability language, avoid certainty
- Include specific action items with reasoning
- Address both bull and bear cases fairly

**Tone:**
- Professional but accessible
- Acknowledge uncertainty and complexity
- Emphasize risk management over prediction
- Provide actionable guidance despite uncertainty
