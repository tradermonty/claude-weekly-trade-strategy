## Growth Leaders to Double Down
- **81. ICEE Float** (+56% vs April): expand marketing tie-ins and capacity coverage
- **Chicken Sandwich Combo (regular & large)** (+32–51%): maintain bundle pricing and queue throughput
- **Cheese Fries Upsize (M/L)** (+44–47%): highlight in digital menu to raise attach rate
- **JP Chashu Bowl** (+39%): validate premium positioning; test regional rollouts

> Insert horizontal bar chart from notebook Cell 13 filtered to top movers

## Revenue Drags to Stabilize
- **Classic ICEE $4.49 flavors** down 22–37%: refresh flavor rotation & signage
- **Wing Platter** down 28%: assess portion value, feast positioning, and wait times
- **Extra Beef Patty add-on** -22%: revisit upsell scripts and pricing gap vs combo

> Consider heatmap or negative bar chart from notebook Cell 15 for board impact

---

## Operational Red Flags
- **Zero-sales months** observed for JP Japanese Combo, Pizza LG Half Topping Extra Cheese, Burger Combo
- Likely drivers: POS toggle, inventory lockout, or deliberate remove without flagging
- Immediate action: **weekly zero-sales alert** from analytics, ops follow-up within 24h
- Track resolution SLA to prevent future revenue leakage

---

## Pricing & Margin Signals
- Large / spicy chicken sandwich combos: **+$2.14–2.28 average price** while sustaining growth
- JP Chashu Bowl: **+$2.02** price lift with demand intact
- Signals headroom for premiumization, but monitor NPS and attach rates monthly
- Standardize pricing review cadence and guardrails before replicating elsewhere

---

## 30-Day Action Plan
1. **Protect core** – Launch Appetizer save plan (promo refresh, ops audit, supply check)
2. **Fuel winners** – Allocate paid media and in-store spotlight to Dessert, Japanese, ICEE Float
3. **Fix availability** – Implement zero-sales alert; confirm menu visibility and stock by store
4. **Optimize pricing** – Convene cross-functional pricing council; leverage combo insights for Q4 menu
5. **Automate reporting** – Schedule monthly regeneration of notebook + Marp deck for leadership
