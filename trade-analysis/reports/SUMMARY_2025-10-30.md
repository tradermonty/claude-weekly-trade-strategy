- **B-Grade:** 1-2% of portfolio per position
- **Maximum Total Exposure:** 10% across all earnings plays
- **Portfolio Heat:** Never exceed 20% total capital at risk

### Stop Loss Rules
- **Hard Stop:** 8-10% below entry (adjust based on volatility)
- **Time Stop:** Exit if targets not hit within expected timeframe

### Entry Timing
- **Best Practice:** Wait for first pullback after gap (30-60 min after open)
- **Volume Confirmation:** Ensure above-average volume on entry day
- **Avoid FOMO:** Don't chase if stock gaps beyond entry zone

### Exit Strategy
