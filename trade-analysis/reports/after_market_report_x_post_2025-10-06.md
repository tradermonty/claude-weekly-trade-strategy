### Additional Context for Responses:

**If asked about AMD:**
"AMD surged on semiconductor strength, hitting $203.71 with 245.8M volume (4.6x average). RSI at 78.97 suggests overbought conditions. P/E of 117.26 is elevated. Watch for consolidation near $200 support."

**If asked about market outlook:**
"Strong tech-led rally but overbought conditions warrant caution. 790 stocks in uptrends, but RSI levels above 75-80 in leaders. Watch for profit-taking. Support: SPY $669, QQQ $605."

**If asked about earnings:**
"Light earnings calendar today. AEHR beat EPS +36.71% despite revenue miss. STZ disappointed on both metrics. Heavier earnings schedule expected later this week."
