### Workday Inc - AVOID / HIGH RISK

**Current Price:** $219.74 (Trading at -6.00% from yesterday's close)

1. **Failed Gap Pattern:** Initial +3.45% after-hours pop completely faded
2. **Weak Technical Position:** -8.01% below 200-day MA, -6.11% below 50-day MA
3. **Negative Momentum:** -2.04% week, -7.44% month, -18.10% YTD
4. **Low Volume:** 0.37x relative volume shows lack of conviction
5. **Below Key MAs:** Both 50-day and 200-day trends broken

### 5-Factor Breakdown:
| Factor | Weight | Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Gap Size | 25% | 10/25 | Gap failed, now negative from yesterday |
| Pre-Earnings Trend | 30% | 9/30 | Downtrend leading into earnings |
| Volume | 20% | 10/20 | 37% of average, weak participation |
| MA200 Position | 15% | 0/15 | -8.01% below, broken long-term trend |
| MA50 Position | 10% | 0/10 | -6.11% below, broken short-term trend |

### Why Market Rejected Despite Beat:
- EPS beat: $2.32 vs $2.18 estimate (+6.4%)
- Revenue beat: $2.43B vs $2.42B estimate (+0.4%)
- **Issue:** Subscription revenue growth outlook disappointed
- Market wanted stronger forward guidance given AI momentum
- High valuation (P/E 92.0) leaving no room for execution concerns

### If You Must Trade (Not Recommended):
- **Wait for:** Base formation at $215-218 support with volume
- **Alternative:** Better risk/reward in ADSK or NTAP
- **Risk:** High - trend is down, volume weak, below key MAs

---

## Market Context

### Sector Overview:
- **Technology Software:** Mixed reactions to earnings despite beats
- **AI Theme:** Continues to drive valuations and expectations
- **Guidance Sensitivity:** Market rewarding confidence (ADSK) and punishing caution (WDAY)

### Trading Environment:
- Market showing selectivity in post-earnings plays
- Volume and technical position crucial for successful continuation
- Higher quality setups (ADSK) performing better than lower quality (WDAY)

---

## Trading Guidelines

### Position Sizing Strategy:
1. **Grade A (ADSK):** 3-4% portfolio allocation
2. **Grade B (NTAP):** 2-3% portfolio allocation
3. **Grade C (WDAY):** 0% - avoid or paper trade only

- **WDAY:** Stay away until technical picture improves

## 5-Factor Scoring Methodology

### Framework (Total: 100 points)

1. **Gap Size (25 points):**
   - Measures magnitude of post-earnings price movement
   - Higher gaps indicate stronger institutional conviction
   - Gap quality matters: held vs faded

2. **Pre-Earnings Trend (30 points):**
   - Evaluates momentum leading into earnings
   - Strong trends more likely to continue post-earnings
   - Considers: weekly, monthly, quarterly performance

3. **Volume (20 points):**
   - Confirms legitimacy of price movement
   - Above average volume = institutional participation
   - Below 0.5x average is concerning

4. **MA200 Position (15 points):**
   - Long-term trend indicator
   - Above = bullish structure
   - Distance from MA indicates trend strength

5. **MA50 Position (10 points):**
   - Short-term trend indicator
   - Above = near-term bullish momentum
   - Confirms or conflicts with MA200

### Grade Scale:
- **A (85-100):** Strong buy - High probability setup
- **B (70-84):** Qualified buy - Good setup with minor concerns
- **C (55-69):** Caution - Significant issues, avoid or small size
- **D (Below 55):** Avoid - Poor setup, high risk

## Key Takeaways

### What Worked:
1. **ADSK:** Beat + raise + technical strength + volume = ideal setup
2. **NTAP:** Solid fundamentals + good technical position = qualified play
3. **Scoring System:** Successfully identified quality differential between setups

### What Didn't Work:
1. **WDAY:** Proves earnings beats alone insufficient
2. **Gap Fading:** Market rejecting weak technical setups regardless of fundamentals
3. **Volume Matters:** Low participation = lack of conviction = failed moves

### Trading Lessons:
1. Technical position matters as much as fundamental results
2. Guidance and outlook often more important than quarterly beat
3. Volume confirms or denies the legitimacy of price action
4. Better to miss a trade than force a poor setup (WDAY)
5. Position sizing should reflect setup quality (Grade A > B > C)

Monitor these stocks for follow-through:
- **ADSK:** Watch $318-320 breakout level
