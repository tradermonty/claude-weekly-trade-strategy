⚡ After-Hours Intel Analysis:

$INTC's +4% rally despite -926% EPS miss tells us:
✅ Market pricing in restructuring benefits
✅ Revenue beat (+7.3%) validates demand
✅ Forward guidance > backward misses
✅ 1M after-hours volume = institutional interest

Key lesson: Earnings reactions focus on future, not past.

🎯 Key Levels for Tomorrow:

$SPY: Watch 672 resistance, support at 668
$QQQ: 611 critical level, breakout could target 615
$IWM: Small-caps need to hold 245 support

💡 Strategy for Tomorrow:

1️⃣ Take profits on extended quantum names ($RGTI, $QBTS)
2️⃣ Look for pullbacks in quality industrials
3️⃣ Monitor $INTC open - does after-hours hold?
4️⃣ Stay long small-caps with tight stops
5️⃣ Watch for defensive sector strength as early warning

Risk management > FOMO
