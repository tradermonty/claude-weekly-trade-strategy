## Key Points Summary

**Market Context (October 1, 2025):**
- Only 2 stocks met earnings gap-up criteria today
- No A-grade (85+) or B-grade (70-84) opportunities identified
- Limited trading opportunities with elevated risk profiles

**$AYI (Acuity Inc) - C-Grade:**
- Moderate risk opportunity with 45-50% success probability
- Strong technical positioning (+18.80% above MA200)
- EPS beat but revenue miss and low volume are concerns
- Already extended after strong YTD run (+19.81%)

**$CAG (Conagra Brands) - D-Grade:**
- High risk - AVOID for momentum trading
- Both EPS and revenue missed expectations
- Severe technical weakness (-18.84% below MA200)
- 46 consecutive 52-week lows indicate persistent selling
- Dividend sustainability concerns raised by analysts

**Trading Recommendation:**
Today's earnings opportunities are LIMITED and carry HIGHER THAN NORMAL RISK. Conservative traders should consider sitting out. Only AYI presents a moderate-risk setup, but even that requires tight risk management with stop-loss at recent support levels.
