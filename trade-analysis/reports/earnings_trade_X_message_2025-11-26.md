### WDAY Warning:
```
$WDAY - Why I'm AVOIDING:

Despite earnings beat:
- Gap +3.45% after-hours FADED
- Now -6% from yesterday's close
- Below 50-day MA (-6.1%)
- Below 200-day MA (-8%)
- Weak volume (0.37x avg)

Grade C: 52/100 score

Earnings beats don't = price strength
Technical matters

## Morning Market Context Post:

```
Tech earnings wrap - Wednesday AM:

Market showing selectivity:
Strong setups (like $ADSK) working
Weak technicals (like $WDAY) failing

Key lesson: Position BEFORE earnings matters
Can't fight the trend

$ADSK: ✅ Uptrend held
$NTAP: ⚠️ Watch for volume
$WDAY: ❌ Downtrend continues

Quality > Quantity
