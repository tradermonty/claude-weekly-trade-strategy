# FB Sales Briefing - English Narration Script

## Slide 1: Title (12 seconds)
"Welcome to the Food and Beverage Sales Briefing covering April through August 2025 results. This executive briefing presents key findings and forward-looking actions for leadership consideration."

## Slide 2: Why This Matters (15 seconds)
"Our summer trading period closed with solid gains: three point five percent revenue growth and four point eight percent unit growth versus our April baseline. However, this growth is masking some emerging weak points in our core Appetizer and legacy ICEE product lines that require immediate attention."

## Slide 3: Financial Performance (15 seconds)
"Looking at our monthly progression, revenue climbed from two point one nine six million in April to two point two seven two million in August. We successfully regained momentum after a May dip, though August showed some unit softness that we're monitoring closely."

## Slide 4: Category Performance (18 seconds)
"Our category analysis reveals clear winners and areas of concern. Dessert led with eleven point six percent growth, followed by Japanese at eight point eight percent and ICEE at nine percent. However, our largest category, Appetizer, despite holding thirty-two point six percent market share, declined by zero point six percent - this needs immediate intervention."

## Slide 5: Growth Leaders (15 seconds)
"Four standout performers deserve doubled investment. ICEE Float surged fifty-six percent - we need expanded marketing and capacity. Chicken Sandwich Combos grew thirty-two to fifty-one percent with maintained pricing. Cheese Fries Upsize jumped forty-four to forty-seven percent - perfect for digital menu promotion. And JP Chashu Bowl gained thirty-nine percent, validating our premium positioning."

## Slide 6: Revenue Drags (12 seconds)
"Three areas demand immediate stabilization. Classic ICEE flavors dropped twenty-two to thirty-seven percent - we need fresh flavor rotation. Wing Platter fell twenty-eight percent - time to assess portion value. And Extra Beef Patty declined twenty-two percent - our upsell scripts need revision."

## Slide 7: Operational Issues (15 seconds)
"We've identified critical operational red flags. Several key items showed zero sales months, likely due to POS toggles or inventory lockouts. We're implementing weekly zero-sales alerts with mandatory twenty-four hour follow-up to prevent future revenue leakage."

## Slide 8: Action Plan (18 seconds)
"Our thirty-day action plan focuses on five priorities. First, protect our core with an Appetizer save plan. Second, fuel our winners by allocating resources to Dessert, Japanese, and ICEE Float. Third, fix availability through automated alerts. Fourth, optimize pricing with a cross-functional council. And fifth, automate our reporting for consistent leadership updates. Thank you for your attention."
