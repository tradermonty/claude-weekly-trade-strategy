Our thirty-day action plan focuses on five priorities. First, protect our core with an Appetizer save plan. Second, fuel our winners by allocating resources to Dessert, Japanese, and ICEE Float. Third, fix availability through automated alerts. Fourth, optimize pricing with a cross-functional council. And fifth, automate our reporting for consistent leadership updates. Thank you for your attention.
